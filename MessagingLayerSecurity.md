# Explainer: Prototype Web API for Messaging Layer Security (MLS)

[Benjamin Beurdouche](mailto:beurdouche@mozilla.com)
Last updated: February 20, 2025

### Overview

This document describes a Web API for the Messaging Layer Security (MLS)
protocol (RFC 9420). MLS provides group key exchange for changing groups, which
enables secure communication within those groups.

### Problem statement

For the longest time, due to the lack of technology, pairwise channels were used
to communicate between two principals (actors of a protocol) and a lot of
additional complexities had to be paid by the Applications on top of the
pairwise channels to build Groups. In particular changing the set of
participants in groups securely was impractical without a significant amount of
expertise and security review.

In most cases those custom group protocols were not well (if at all) specified
nor formally analyzed. Most of the security guarantees provided by strong
pairwise channels are broken by applications in non-trivial ways because those
typically don’t provide group agreement (everyone has the same view of the group
and its secrets) or even the correct notion of authentication or secrecy.
Performance was also a concern as the computational complexity of creating
groups or sending messages based on pairwise channels is quite high (O(N^2)) and
incompatible with large dynamic groups.

We aim at solving this issue in the Web Platform by following the WebRTC example
and provide a way for Applications to build evolving groups of participants.
This enables applications for **secure group communication** including
video-conferencing (SFrameTransform for WebRTC, Media Over QUIC,...), secure
messaging (RCS, MIMI), encrypted cloud storage, and more.

### Proposal

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) (RFC 9420) provides convenient and secure
***Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) for dynamic groups***, ranging from one
to hundreds of thousands of participants.

The MLS API provides applications with two main capabilities:

* Group management: applications can manage the participation of different
  entities, including the current browser, in groups.

* Secure messaging: once
  created, a group generates a shared secret that can be used to provide
  end-to-end protected messaging with group participants.

 This explainer outlines the goals, design, and potential use cases of the API.

### Goals

1. **Provide a Continuous Group Key Agreement**: We want to enable Web and
Internet applications to use MLS as a way to build and manage groups using its
secure group key establishment directly from the browser, in particular for
End-to-End Encrypted applications.

2. **State-of-the-Art Security**: Manipulate sensitive values and cryptographic
secrets of the protocol natively instead of exposing them to the web
application. Shipping an up-to-date MLS library which removes the need for
application developers to have a dedicated evaluation and software lifecycle for
this critical component. Similar to TLS, QUIC or WebRTC, ensure to provide a
high quality implementation to users.

3. **Privacy and avoid user tracking**: Prevent user tracking by using
traditional techniques of partitioning the MLS state by origin. This will ensure
that strong identifiers like public keys are not reused across sites.

4. **Ensure Performance**: Avoid back and forth between JavaScript, C++, storage
and cryptographic computations. Handle everything natively within browser native
code.

### Non-Goals

1. **Expose all possible MLS functionality**: The MLS protocol does not
currently have a “standard” API as it can be used in many different ways. We
will provide a significant subset of all these possibilities starting with safe
defaults and will listen for feedback in case extensions are requested by
developers.

2. **Guarantee full interoperability across applications**: We cannot force that
different applications are interoperable, especially in a federated
context. However if service providers decide to agree on interoperability at the
application level by defining coherent MLS group and client configurations, the
MLS layer messages will be interoperable and applications will be able to build
a shared group.

### How do I enable the experiment ?

If you are not already part of an Origin Trial, navigate to **\`about:config\`**.

For Firefox 135: set **\`security.mls.enabled\`** to **\`true\`**.

For Firefox 136+: set **\`dom.origin-trials.mls.state\`** to **\`1\`**.

### Terminology

A few key concepts of the MLS protocol that are necessary to understand the API.

**Identities and Credentials**

The client is a participant in the protocol which is owned by users. Each
client, whether it is part of a group or not, has a unique identity or client
identifier which is a handle to a signature keypair. Each client can be
associated with a credential which is a way to reflect additional information
related to the identity.  The default API offers a facility to create
credentials containing arbitrary strings called basic credentials but X509 or a
verifiable credential can be generated externally and be used in the API.

**Key Package**

In order for users to add clients to a group, those need to
produce some encryption public key and some metadata about the ciphersuite and
extension they support for that client. This information is called a key
package. By default the API contains a function to generate those key packages
with the default parameters and extensions supported by the implementation in
Firefox.

**Groups and GroupViews**

Since the goal of MLS is to build and manage groups, the API is centered about
the notion of group and in particular of the GroupView object which represents
the view of a group for a specific client. The reason for this is that it is
allowed to have multiple clients in a group as long as they have different
client identifiers. Though it is an advanced feature, if multiple clients are
used in the same group, each client is able to manage its view of the group and
may process messages at different times. Each time the group evolves, a sequence
number called epoch is incremented.

**Proposals and Commits**

Group operations such as adding or removing users can be either proposed by
generating a proposal or the change can be made directly by generating a commit
output. Each commit output contains some information, when adding a user, it
contains a commit message, which is the information that needs to be transmitted
to existing members of the group, and a welcome message which is the information
that needs to be transmitted to the newly added client.

### Basic usage

```javascript
let mls = new MLS()

// Create identities for alice and bob
let a = await mls.generateIdentity()
let b = await mls.generateIdentity()

// Create credentials for alice and bob
let ac = await mls.generateCredential("alice")
let bc = await mls.generateCredential("bob")

// Create key packages for alice and bob
let akp = await mls.generateKeyPackage(a, ac)
let bkp = await mls.generateKeyPackage(b, bc)

// Bob creates a group
let gb = await mls.groupCreate(b, bc)

// Bob adds Alice to the group by using the Key Package
// (this generates a commit output which contains the welcome necessary
// to alice and the commit to update current members of the group)
let co1 = await gb.add(akp)

// Bob uses the generated commit to update its group and immediately
// sends a message to the group (alice, bob)
let bgide1 = await gb.receive(co1.commit)
let ctx1 = await gb.send("Hello Alice!")

// Alice uses the welcome to join the group and receives Bob's message
let ga = await mls.groupJoin(a, co1.welcome)
let pt1 = await ga.receive(ctx1)
```

Note that, to ease testing, the code above runs both participants
but each browser will typically run one participant.

### A more advanced example…

```javascript
// !!!
// < Insert the code for the basic example here... >
// !!!

// Charlie creates identity keypair, credential and key package
let c = await mls.generateIdentity()
let cc = await mls.generateCredential("charlie")
let ckp = await mls.generateKeyPackage(c, cc)

// Alice adds Charlie to the group
let co2 = await ga.add(ckp)

// Alice and Bob process the commit which is adding Charlie
let agide2 = await ga.receive(co2.commit)
let bgide2 = await gb.receive(co2.commit)

// Charlie joins the group and sends a message
let gc = await mls.groupJoin(c, co2.welcome)
let ctx2 = await gc.send("Hi all")

// Alice and Bob receive charlie's message
let apt2 = await ga.receive(ctx2)
let bpt2 = await gb.receive(ctx2)

// Charlie removes Bob from the group
let co3 = await gc.remove(b)

// Each member receives the commit removing Bob
let agide3 = await ga.receive(co3.commit)
let bgide3 = await gb.receive(co3.commit)
let cgide3 = await gc.receive(co3.commit)

// Alice proposes to be removed from the group
let p4 = await ga.proposeRemove(a)

// Charlie processes the proposal and generates a commit output
let co4 = await gc.receive(p4)

// Alice and Charlie process the commit to remove Alice
let agide4 = await ga.receive(co4.commitOutput.commit)
let cgide4 = await gc.receive(co4.commitOutput.commit)

// Generate identities, credentials and key packages for
// delphine and ernest
let d = await mls.generateIdentity()
let e = await mls.generateIdentity()
let dc = await mls.generateCredential("delphine")
let ec = await mls.generateCredential("ernest")
let dkp = await mls.generateKeyPackage(d, dc)
let ekp = await mls.generateKeyPackage(e, ec)

// Charlie adds Delphine to the Group and process the commit
let co5 = await gc.add(dkp)
let cgide5 = await gc.receive(co5.commit)

// Delphine uses the welcome to join the group
let gd = await mls.groupJoin(d, co5.welcome)

// Delphine proposes to add Ernest to the group
let p6 = await gd.proposeAdd(ekp)

// Charlie generate a commit output for Delphine's proposa to add Ernest
let rec6 = await gc.receive(p6)

// Charlie and Delphine process the commit to add Ernest
let cgide6 = await gc.receive(rec6.commitOutput.commit)
let dgide6 = await gd.receive(rec6.commitOutput.commit)

// Ernest joins the group
let ge = await mls.groupJoin(e, rec6.commitOutput.welcome)

// Create exporter labels and context ("context" in ASCII)
const context_bytes = new Uint8Array([99, 111, 110, 116, 101, 120, 116]); const exporter_len = 32;

// Ernest generates an exporter secret
let exporterOutput = await ge.exportSecret(
	"label", context_bytes, exporter_len);

// This is the shared secret for the group at this epoch
let secret = exporterOutput.secret;

// Display group information for all group views
console.log(await gc.details())
console.log(await gd.details())
console.log(await ge.details())
```

### Notes and additional information

**Exporting secrets for your application**

While sending and receiving MLS application messages through the API is very
convenient, applications sometimes need to generate secrets for their own
use. These symmetric secrets can be generated via the export\_secret API
function using a specific label and context. Generating such secrets is safe and
does not expose anything about the internal secret state of the protocol as this
is done through a KDF. Note that the secret is specific to a specific epoch of
the group.

**Partitioning and storage in the browser**

As of now, the MLS state is stored encrypted at rest in the profile of the user,
similar to credentials so that it can later be migrated. The key for each
database is currently located in the same directory along the encrypted
database.  The state is partitioned by Origin (origin+originAttributeSuffix) and
this was checked with multiple teams, including Privacy and Storage.

**Notes on deleting MLS public and secret state**

The MLS state for the origin (including secrets) can be deleted by the
application by calling the delete state function of the API from within this
origin. The user can also clean the state using the UI to “clear all site data”
(by clicking on the lock icon) or by calling the API via the console if they
don’t wish to clear their cookies at the same time.

**Notes on security for large groups**

It is often asked why anyone would think a thousand participant group could be
honest. The formal security guarantees are the same at a scale of two
participants and for large groups: the cryptographic properties are that \- when
\- the members of the group are honest then during that period of time you
benefit from great Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise-Security properties.

### Ongoing work

- Alignment with other platforms such as Android
- Web Application Integrity, Consistency and Transparency effort
- Interaction with WebRTC \+ SFrame / MLS
- Get feedback to be in a good shape before submitting to standardization

### Next steps

- We will have to decide about an improved UX and UI for the long state storage,
  and the permissions to add and clear state.
- We expect to provide **custom proposals** and **external join** features.
- We also will likely extend the API to take lists of users to Add and Remove to
     reduce the number of messages to send to other participants.
- We anticipate that there will be a need for the application and users to
  annotate identifiers from other users in a way that cannot be modified by
  applications (e.g. to record that a user identity has been authenticated out
  of bound).
- Consider and discuss the idea of migrating the management of MLS cryptographic
  keys to the Credential Manager.

### Conclusion

The experimental Web API for Messaging Layer Security aims to provide a robust,
privacy-preserving solution for secure group communication on the web and the
internet. As this is not a web-standard, the feature has to be enabled in
about:config.

In parallel of this effort, Mozilla is partnering with major actors of the
industry to bring more guarantees to users when running security and privacy
critical sites through Web Application integrity, consistency and transparency
mechanisms which will help

By leveraging MLS and aligning with open standards, Mozilla seeks to enhance
user security and foster innovation within the web platform community.
