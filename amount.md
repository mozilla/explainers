## User problems to be solved

On the web, users from around the world often see numerical amounts on web pages either in unfamiliar units, 
or with unfamiliar punctuation denoting large or decimal amounts which can either be hard to interpret, or worse, easily misinterpreted. 
If publishers had a mechanism to explicitly denote these numerical amounts and their units if any, 
then browsers could offer a privacy-respecting user-interface to display these amounts to the user according to their local units and punctuation preferences.
